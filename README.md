# trendbarometer
## A tool that seeks to establish which markets / stocks are more strongly in an uptrend or in a downtrend. 

### This is motivated by the CTA philosophy of being market agnostic and profiting through diversification by going long those markets in an uptrend and short those in a downtrend.

#### The library provides methods to:
  - Extract historical OHLC data for commodities from Norgate Data and S&P 500 from Yahoo Finance.
  - Calculate various technical indicators over a range of time periods and aggregate to determine trend strength. 
  - Display Bar chart, Line chart and multiple chart grid of various markets based on trend strength.
